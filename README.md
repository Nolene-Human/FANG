This application is built of the back of a Bachelor of Software Engineering Cybersecurity assignment to investigate a solution with recomemnded improvements.

The solution is to provide an educational and easy to use cybersecurity tool. 

 a) What is considered a complete cybersecurity solution? 

b) What are the current and future cybersecurity solutions in each of the areas? 

c) What do my users need? 

d) What can be built in this phase of the project?
